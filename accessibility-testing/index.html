                    <p>Hello, my name is Paulina Cosma, and I am a MLIS student at the University of Denver, as well
                        as a current volunteer at this library. This term, I am taking a Web Content course, and we
                        are learning about the importance of digital accessibility and effective strategies to make
                        web content more inclusive for people with disabilities, including those who use assistive
                        technologies. We were asked to perform accessibility testing on a local organization’s
                        website to identify potential issues that might prevent people with disabilities or those
                        using assistive devices from accessing the information easily. I chose to test your website.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p><b>Did you know?</b> <br>
                        As of July 15, 2024, the CDC reported that more than one in four adults in the United States
                        has a disability, representing 28.7% of the total population (CDC, 2024).</p> <br>
                    <p>This report aims to help The Plainsboro Public Library better align with Section 508 and the
                        Americans with Disabilities Act Title II Regulations. The accessibility checklist is based
                        on the W3C Easy Checks. Assessment tools like WAVE and ANDI, along with keyboard testing,
                        were used. I hope this report proves helpful. Thank you for reviewing my recommendations.

                    <p>Page titles are important because they help all users navigate browser tabs when multiple
                        webpages are open. More importantly, they are the first thing screen readers read to help users
                        with disabilities in knowing where they are. The best way to make page titles accessible is to
                        “front-load' critical or unique information first. Currently, your page titles read:</p>
                    <ul class="text-bg-warning">
                        <li>Book Club – Plainsboro Public library</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>I recommend updating your titles to match the approach used with your Book Club Webpage:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="text-bg-warning">Image Text Alternatives: Needs Improvement</h3>
                    <p>Text alternatives, also known as “alt text," are essential because they convey the purpose of
                        images, such as pictures, illustrations, and other visual elements, to users who are unable to
                        see them. This includes individuals using screen readers or those who disable images to speed up
                        loading times or save bandwidth. The aim of this text is to provide an equivalent user
                        experience, not just to describe the image.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">
                        While many of your pages use alt text to identify images, several do not. Additionally, the
                        quality of the existing alt text on images that have it needs improvement. On your Book Club
                        page, the linked images in the Upcoming Reads rotating image carousel lack alternative text.
                        When displaying banners or posters, all information that someone without a visual disability can
                        read on the image should also be accessible to patrons using screen readers, including event
                        dates and times, not just the title, as I observed in your events carousel on the Events &
                        Bookings page. Similarly, on your Events & Bookings page, two images have title attributes but
                        no alt attributes. Additionally, on the Events & Bookings page, I noticed several table
                        elements; none have headers, which could confuse users with screen readers, as all the
                        information would appear as unstructured table data. The Art Gallery page uses ARIA labels in
                        the image carousel; unfortunately,
                        they are numbered and do not provide helpful information for screen reader users. I also noticed
                        that your footer element is missing alt text for the consortium logo, as well as the logos for
                        the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.</p>
                    <p>I recommend manually reviewing each page on your website to verify that your alt-text is accurate
                        and provides sufficient, concise information about images. For images with title attributes but
                        without alt text, consider adding an ARIA label to provide additional accessibility information.
                        To improve your table, add a hidden table header that enables screen readers to better interpret
                        the table data. In this ARIA label, you can include the text on your drop-down menu, such as
                        aria-label="Select a Library." Also, based on how it appears on
                        your site, consider removing the two dashes before and after the phrase, as screen readers will
                        read it as "dash-dash Select a Library dash-dash." For your footer, specify what each image
                        represents, such as "Stella Consortium logo,” “Apple App Store Logo,” and “Google Play Store
                        Logo.” You might also consider linking to the Apple and Google stores.</p>
                    <h3>Text:</h3>
                    <h4 class="text-bg-warning">Headings: Needs Improvement</h4>
                    <p>Headings help users who cannot use a mouse or rely on screen readers understand the page's
                        structure, similar to a table of contents. Screen readers also use headings to navigate through
                        a page. Headings are organized hierarchically, and each page should contain only one level 1
                        heading.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">After reviewing your pages, the headings need improvement. I noticed
                        several level one headings in the footers, but there are no level one headings in the main
                        content areas. As
                        previously mentioned, only one level one element should be used per webpage to create a
                        proper hierarchy for screen readers and make information easier to access. The presence of
                        multiple level one elements within the footer may cause confusion for users utilizing screen
                        readers, as this practice does not establish a clear hierarchical structure. Navigating such
                        pages can be challenging for screen reader users because level one headings typically denote the
                        primary purpose or topic of a page.Instead
                        of using a level one heading in the main content section, level two tags are used for section
                        titles,
                        often with multiple level two elements being the only headings present.
                        Similarly, having multiple level one elements in the footer can confuse
                        users
                        relying on screen readers, as it doesn’t establish a clear
                        hierarchy. Navigating these pages could be frustrating or impossible
                        because of the difficulty in telling apart the two level one elements.
                        On
                        your Art Gallery page, heading levels jump from level two to level four
                        without an level three tag in between, which hurts accessibility
                        by
                        breaking the logical flow.</p>
                    <p>I recommend incorporating an
                        level one header into your primary content, preferably
                        as
                        the initial element within that section.
                        Additionally, guarantee that all headings are
                        arranged in a logical sequence without
                        omissions. Moreover, eliminate the level one
                        elements
                        from your footer and modify your CSS to
                        enlarge the text or style it according to
                        your preference, ensuring that accessibility
                        for users with visual impairments remains
                        uncompromised.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-bg-warning">Contrast Ratio
                        (color contrast): Needs Improvement </h4>
                    <p>Color contrast usually refers to the difference between the background color and the text. Some
                        people need enough contrast between the text and background to read comfortably. High contrast
                        is essential for those with visual impairments and many older adults who have reduced contrast
                        sensitivity. However, for people with reading disabilities, bright colors might be hard to read.
                        For regular-sized text, a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 is recommended.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning"> On the Book Club page: <br>
                        The highlight color of your tabs in the drop-down menu does not meet the minimum contrast ratio,
                        with a ratio of 1.63:1. The dates in your events carousel also fail to meet the minimum contrast
                        ratio, with a ratio of 2.81:1. Additionally, the white text on the yellow background in your
                        footer has a contrast ratio of 1.68:1.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning"> On the Visually Impaired Services page: <br>
                        The tab highlight color remains problematic, as does the white text on a yellow background in
                        your footer. However, under Directory Services, your Visually Impaired Services link appears in
                        a pale green with a 2.32:1 contrast ratio. It's also worth noting that clicking on that link
                        takes you back to the same webpage you're currently viewing; removing it entirely might be a
                        better option.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning"> On the Events & Bookings page: <br>
                        Any white text on the blue background and any blue text on the white background do not meet the
                        minimum contrast ratio, instead reflecting a 3.66:1 ratio. Overall, this page has 109 contrast
                        errors.<br>
                        On the Art Gallery page: <br>
                        The tab highlight color remains an issue, as does the white text on a yellow background in your
                        footer. Another contrast problem is the links beneath your Latest Exhibit posters, which have a
                        contrast ratio of 2.3:1. </p>
                    <p>I suggest downloading and using ANDI to review your pages, as this tool offers an accessible
                        option that most closely aligns with your original color choice. You can then update your CSS to
                        match these accessible color selections.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-center text-bg-warning">Zoom 200% Resize
                        Text: Needs Improvement</h4>
                    <p>Increasing the size of text and images to 200% or more is sometimes used to enhance readability
                        for people with visual impairments. Users should be able to access all information or navigation
                        options while zoomed in, as some disabilities prevent horizontal scrolling, and most people
                        cannot effectively read text in this way.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">Three of the four webpages I assessed resized themselves flawlessly. It
                        was highly encouraging to observe. Unfortunately, your Events & Booking page experienced an
                        issue where the Events by Category categories did not resize properly, resulting in continuous
                        horizontal scrolling being necessary for users to access all categories.</p>
                    <p>My recommendation is to change the nav-tabs code from aria-orientation=“horizontal” to
                        “vertical”. Although users still need to scroll, vertical scrolling is generally more
                        accessible.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-bg-warning">Mobile View: Needs Improvement</h4>
                    <p>In this digital age, users can access your website from various devices, including their mobile
                        phones. The mobile view is used to ensure that accessibility is maintained on smaller screens
                        without compromising the website's integrity.</p>
                    <p>The Book Club and Visually Impaired Services page both looked great in the mobile view; they
                        scaled down really well and retained their integrity when I zoomed in. </p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">The Events & Bookings and Art Gallery pages, however, did not scale down
                        well, requiring users to horizontally scroll to view the page. I believe this is a result of the
                        carousels located at the tops of these pages. Furthermore, when you zoom in on these pages, the
                        problem worsens.</p>
                    <p>I recommend moving the carousels away from the top of the page. Also, compare the code from the
                        Book Club and Visually Impaired pages with that of the Events & Bookings and Art Gallery pages
                        to identify what is affecting the mobile view.

                    <h3>Interaction:</h3>
                    <h4 class="text-bg-warning">Keyboard Access and
                        Visual Focus: Needs Improvement</h4>
                    <p>Keyboard focus acts as a visible signal, highlighting the element currently in focus on a
                        webpage. Many people cannot use a mouse, and those who are visually impaired or have mobility
                        impairments often depend on keyboard navigation or assistive technologies that use keyboard
                        commands. For users relying on keyboards for navigation, it is crucial to clearly identify which
                        element has focus.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning"> On the Book Club, Visually Impaired Services, and Art Gallery pages, the
                        visual focus disappears after navigating the drop-down menu. On the Book Club tab, it requires
                        23 tab presses for keyboard focus to return. On the Visually Impaired Services page, the
                        Directory of Services is completely inaccessible when using only the keyboard. On the Art
                        Gallery page, it takes 22 tab presses to restore continuous keyboard focus. On the Event &
                        Bookings page, the 'Skip to Content' link does not send you to the main content as intended.
                        Additionally, there is no way to skip tabbing through the Upcoming Events list, which covers six
                        weeks of events. Finally, on this page, keyboard-only users cannot navigate through the Events
                        by Category sections, since only “Featured” is highlighted.</p>
                    <p>I recommend reviewing your code to ensure that all interactive elements like buttons and links,
                        have a tab index set to 0. On the Visually Impaired Services page, it appears that the links not
                        accessible via keyboard control are all set to -1. Additionally, review your nav-link-category
                        code on the Events & Bookings page and remove the role=“presentation” attribute, as this causes
                        screen readers to skip this list item. Instead, use the code you have for the featured button
                        and duplicate it, modifying it to match each category to ensure accessibility for keyboard-only
                        users.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-bg-warning">Skip to Main: Needs Improvement</h4>
                    <p>A skip to main link offers faster and simpler access to the main page content for keyboard-only
                        users, screen reader users, and other users of assistive technology. Without this link, users
                        would have to navigate through all menu items and search boxes each time they want to reach the
                        main content, which wastes time and effort.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">All four web pages I evaluated included a “Skip to Main” feature in
                        keyboard-only navigation; however, only three of them actually directed users to the main
                        content of the page. The Events & Bookings page failed to direct users to the main content but
                        was able to direct users to the footer content, which served as a secondary navigational option.
                        When using the link to navigate to the main content, however, the user remained in the same
                        position as they were in the events carousel.</p>
                    <p>I suggest adding a level one heading in the main content and including an anchor target for that
                        section in your code.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-bg-warning">Forms, Labels, and
                        Errors: Needs Improvement</h4>
                    <p>Form field labels refer to the descriptions positioned adjacent to form fields. They specify the
                        type of information to be entered or the options to be selected, such as checkboxes. These
                        labels are crucial for ensuring that all users understand how to interact effectively with a
                        form. </p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">The only form present on all the webpages I evaluated was the search bar
                        located in the top right corner. On the Book Club, Visually Impaired Services, and Art Gallery
                        pages, your search box appears to have duplicate IDs in the code, such as input id="SearchBox”
                        and button id="SearchButton.” A div element separates them; however, only one ID should be used
                        per page. It also lacks a proper label for the search text field, so screen readers would not
                        understand how to interpret this field. You do have radio buttons labeled; however, a screen
                        reader may not be able to decipher what the group is for without an aria-label or a fieldset
                        with a legend.</p>
                    <p>My recommendation is to remove the duplicate block concerning the IDs, add a screen-reader-only
                        hidden label to the search text field, and include a fieldset with a legend to help screen
                        readers interpret the information more effectively.</p>
                    <h3>General:</h3>
                    <h4 class="text-bg-warning">Moving, Flashing, or
                        Blinking Content: Needs Improvement</h4>
                    <p>Moving, flashing, or blinking content, such as carousels and videos, can be distracting. Users
                        should have control over this moving content, as it can pose challenges for individuals with
                        attention deficit disorder or visual processing issues. Accessibility concerns include people
                        who read and process information slowly, have difficulty tracking moving objects, or struggle to
                        focus on other parts of the webpage because of the moving content. Additionally, blinking
                        content can trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy, especially if it flashes
                        more than three times per second, covers a large part of the screen, and is bright enough.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">Three of the four webpages I assessed had moving carousels, but only the
                        Events & Bookings page
                        had a pause button.</p>
                    <p>I suggest adding carousel buttons to all your carousels, similar to those on the Events &
                        Bookings page. Using the existing code and modifying it if needed will be the easiest solution.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Multimedia (video,
                        audio) Alternatives and Closed
                        Captioning: Not Applicable</h4>
                    <p>Multimedia alternatives and closed captioning help people who are blind or have low vision access
                        visual information. Similarly, captions and text transcripts help people who are deaf or hard of
                        hearing in accessing audio content. There are three types of multimedia alternatives to
                        consider: captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions. Captions are written versions of speech
                        and non-speech audio that are necessary to understand the video, and they are displayed
                        alongside the video. <strong>Please note that automatic captions are rarely sufficient for
                            accessibility because they often lack accuracy and proper grammar.</strong> Transcripts are
                        written versions of speech and non-speech information from audio content, made available
                        separately from the video. Audio descriptions provide visual details needed to comprehend the
                        content, including text shown in the video.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-bg-warning">Basic Structure
                        Check: Needs Improvement</h4>
                    <p>This check disables images and display styles to identify what a user using a screen reader or
                        other assistive devices would “see” when interacting with a website. Once the webpage
                        information is “linearized,” it becomes easier to identify where potential accessibility issues
                        may occur.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">On the Book Club, Visually Impaired Services, and Art Gallery page, the
                        search box appears twice,
                        once before the menu and again immediately after it. Also, the consortium logo, the Apple App
                        Store, and the Google Play Store all appear at the end.</p>
                    <p>I recommend reviewing the section of code that precedes and ends the menu items so you can remove
                        the redundancy that causes the user to return to the search box at the end of the menu.
                        Similarly, in the footer, include alt text for the logos and consider adding links to the Apple
                        App Store and Google Play Store, labeling them accordingly.
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">On the Book Club page, although images have been disabled, your top
                        banner, which I had assumed
                        was a photo, remains visible. Immediately following the "Upcoming Reads" paragraph, there is a
                        significant gap with no text or pictures, preceded by a date, a time, a link, and then "History
                        Room" with seven empty bullet points. "View Details" concludes the section. This pattern is
                        repeated three times. The following pattern is essentially the same as the first, though there
                        is now a poster “image” in the space where the large gap existed in the first pattern. This is
                        repeated three times before repeating the same pattern, featuring ample blank space, three more
                        times.</p>
                    <p>I suggest labeling your banner as an image and adding alternative text to it. Similarly, review
                        your carousel code and remove any unnecessary elements. More importantly, make sure all links
                        are properly labeled and identified, and label the posters as images with alt text.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">On the Visually Impaired Services page the banner image continues to be
                        visible when images are
                        disabled, indicating that it is not properly labeled.</p>
                    <p>Be sure to label this element as an image and include alt text because screen readers and other
                        assistive devices cannot interpret images that aren’t correctly labeled.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">On the Events & Bookings page, parts of the Plainsboro Public Library
                        logo are visible, along
                        with posters in the events carousel. The "Filter by category” option appears twice, once in the
                        upcoming event section and again lower on the page. Without headings near the other filter
                        groupings, it's unclear whether this filter is redundant or intended for a different purpose.
                        There's also an automated graphic that does not appear on the webpage when images and style
                        sheets are enabled. Due to the improper formatting of what seems to be a calendar, the
                        information is unclear for a significant portion of this linearized page. After the “Events by
                        Category” hyperlink section, there are several incorrectly structured tables that lack headers,
                        contain nonsensical content, and make it difficult to determine whether this is one table or
                        multiple tables, especially considering that when the style sheet and images are enabled,
                        multiple tables are present. Unfortunately, this page needs considerable improvement.</p>
                    <p>Label decorative images accordingly and provide appropriate alt text for all other images.
                        Evaluate whether the 'Filter by category' is redundant and, if not, assign it to the correct
                        section. Adding headings throughout this page would greatly enhance navigation and
                        understanding. Review your code to identify that graphic and remove it; it’s not present on your
                        styled page and is unnecessary. Format your calendar as a table with clear headers and scope.
                        Include a caption that describes the table, such as the month and year. Do not merge or split
                        cells, as this can confuse screen readers by disrupting the expected grid layout. Apply these
                        guidelines to all tables on the page. Using semantic tags like table, th, and td helps screen
                        readers correctly interpret the relationship between the cell and the header correctly.</p>
                    <p class="text-bg-warning">On the Art Gallery page, twelve images from the carousel are displayed,
                        with some being
                        duplicates. This is followed by a paragraph about the library art gallery and then the “Our
                        Latest Exhibits” section. In this last section, posters showcasing past exhibits are shown.</p>
                    <p>To make this page more accessible, label the images as such and add alt text to help screen
                        readers understand the content on the page. </p>

                        accessibility, most of the pages I reviewed were well-designed. Some pages only require minor
                        changes to ensure universal access, while others will require more extensive work. I appreciate
                        all that you do for our community. I sincerely hope you find my assessment helpful. Thank you
