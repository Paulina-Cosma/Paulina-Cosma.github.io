        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <!-- Quick blurb about myself. -->
        <p>
            I am a native Angeleno who has spent the better part of a decade living in New Jersey. During that time, I
            have worked as a flight attendant for a major U.S. airline, an EMT, and a substitute teacher, sometimes all
            simultaneously. <br> I enjoy challenges and am eager to see what I can learn and create this term.
        </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- More in-depth information about myself. -->
        <ul>
            <li>Location: Plainsboro, NJ </li>
            <li>Why LIS: Compared to TSA checkpoints, the peaceful calm of a library feels captivating. I have enjoyed
                my time as a flight attendant and all my amazing travel experiences. Still, I often feel
                under-stimulated at work and believe I could do more with my life to help people. I want to pursue my
                masterâ€™s
                in library and information science to make a difference and inspire a love for reading and learning in
                others.
